The “0x05. N queens” project is a classic problem in computer science and mathematics, known for its application of the backtracking algorithm to place N non-attacking queens on an N×N chessboard. To successfully complete this project, you will need to understand several key concepts and have access to resources that will help you grasp the necessary algorithms and techniques.

Concepts Needed:
Backtracking Algorithms:

Understanding how backtracking algorithms work to explore all potential solutions to a problem and backtrack when a solution cannot be completed.
Backtracking Introduction
Recursion:

AFTER RESEARCH
Given an N x N chessboard, place N queens on the board such that no two queens threaten each other. In chess, a queen can attack horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.

Here's a simple Python implementation of the N Queens problem using backtracking:

def is_safe(board, row, col, N):
    # Check the row on the left side
    for i in range(col):
        if board[row][i] == 1:
            return False

    # Check upper diagonal on left side
    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):
        if board[i][j] == 1:
            return False

    # Check lower diagonal on left side
    for i, j in zip(range(row, N), range(col, -1, -1)):
        if board[i][j] == 1:
            return False

    return True

def solve_n_queens_util(board, col, N):
    if col >= N:
        return True

    for i in range(N):
        if is_safe(board, i, col, N):
            board[i][col] = 1

            if solve_n_queens_util(board, col + 1, N):
                return True

            board[i][col] = 0

    return False

def solve_n_queens(N):
    board = [[0] * N for _ in range(N)]

    if not solve_n_queens_util(board, 0, N):
        print("Solution does not exist")
        return False

    print_board(board)
    return True

def print_board(board):
    for row in board:
        print(" ".join(map(str, row)))

# Example usage:
n = 4
solve_n_queens(n)


Explanation:

is_safe function checks whether it is safe to place a queen at a given position on the board. It checks for conflicts with other queens in the same row, upper diagonal, and lower diagonal.

solve_n_queens_util function is a recursive function that tries to place queens on the board column by column. It backtracks if it finds that it's not possible to place a queen in a certain column.

solve_n_queens function initializes the board and starts the solving process.

print_board function is just a utility function to print the final solution.

This implementation uses backtracking to efficiently explore the solution space and find a valid solution for the N Queens problem.
