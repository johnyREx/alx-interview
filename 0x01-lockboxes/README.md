Lockboxes in Python
Overview
Lockboxes are a data structure problem commonly encountered in technical interviews and coding challenges. The problem involves a scenario where you're given n number of lockboxes, each containing a list of keys. The keys in these lockboxes can also unlock other lockboxes, and your task is to determine if you can unlock all the lockboxes. This problem can be solved efficiently using graph traversal algorithms, such as depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS).

Problem Statement
Given a list of lockboxes, where each lockbox is represented by a list of keys, determine if you can unlock all the lockboxes. You can start with the first lockbox and use the keys inside it to unlock other lockboxes. If at any point you cannot unlock a lockbox, return False. Otherwise, return True if you can successfully unlock all lockboxes.

Implementation
Python Version
This implementation is compatible with Python 3.x.

Dependencies
No external dependencies are required for this implementation.

Code Structure
The implementation consists of a single function:


def can_unlock_all(lockboxes):
    """
    Determine if all lockboxes can be unlocked.

    Args:
    lockboxes (list): A list of lockboxes where each lockbox is represented by a list of keys.

    Returns:
    bool: True if all lockboxes can be unlocked, False otherwise.
    """
    visited = set()
    stack = [0]  # Start with the first lockbox
    while stack:
        box_index = stack.pop()
        if box_index not in visited:
            visited.add(box_index)
            keys = lockboxes[box_index]
            stack.extend(key for key in keys if key < len(lockboxes))
    return len(visited) == len(lockboxes)
Function Explanation
can_unlock_all(lockboxes): This function takes a list of lockboxes as input and returns True if all lockboxes can be unlocked, False otherwise.
lockboxes: A list of lockboxes where each lockbox is represented by a list of keys.
The function initializes a set called visited to keep track of visited lockboxes and a stack to perform depth-first traversal.
It starts with the first lockbox (box_index = 0) and iterates through its keys, pushing them onto the stack.
It continues the traversal until the stack is empty, checking if all lockboxes have been visited.
Finally, it returns True if the number of visited lockboxes equals the total number of lockboxes, indicating that all lockboxes can be unlocked.
Usage
To use this implementation, you can call the can_unlock_all() function and pass a list of lockboxes as an argument. Here's an example:


lockboxes = [[1], [2], [3], []]
print(can_unlock_all(lockboxes))  # Output: True
This example creates a list of lockboxes where each lockbox has the keys to the next lockbox. Since all lockboxes can be unlocked in this scenario, the function returns True.

Performance Considerations
Time Complexity: The time complexity of this implementation is O(N + K), where N is the number of lockboxes and K is the total number of keys across all lockboxes. This complexity arises from traversing through all lockboxes and their keys once.Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(N), where N is the number of lockboxes. This is due to the space required for the visited set and the stack.
Conclusion
This README provides an implementation and explanation of solving the lockboxes problem in Python. By utilizing graph traversal techniques, we efficiently determine if all lockboxes can be unlocked. The provided implementation is both concise and easy to understand, making it suitable for coding interviews and practice exercises.
